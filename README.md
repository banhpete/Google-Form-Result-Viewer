## 1. Introduction
The Google Form works well as a tool to collect data from it's user, however it can be quite challenging for a user to view their submission especially when the feature for the an email reply is turned off.

While this issue can be resolved by having the google form send a user the response receipt, the user may still find it challenging to sift through their email the reply from the google from.

As a result, this markdown will detail a web app solution to allow users to view their google form submissions all in one place.

## 2. Project Requirements
The Web App solution must include the following:
- When displaying the results of a google form, the user accessing the web app must only see the results they submit.
- Work with the Google Spreadsheet API that contains the data from the Google Form
- Results must be presented in a chronological order
- Results must be easily viewed

## 3. Google Form Submission Reviewer
The proposed Google Form Submission Reviewer will consists of three parts:
- The Google Spreadsheet that will act as the database and hold the submission data.
- The Google Script code is the server side code that the client will call.
- The HTML files that will be sent to the client to display the web app solution. These HTML files will also contain the style files and script files because it will be served through Google's App Script platform which only accepts HTML files.

### 3.1 The Google Spreadsheet
The google spreadsheet will contain the submission data from the form in the Form Response tab. Each row in this tab represent a submission. A user wil not require all this data, they will only need specific data.  Therefore we will need to grab the data we want for a specifc user. Therefore there will be a second tab which will specify what rows of data belong to a user. This second sheet shall also have the email of the user and a unique ID generated by the GS code.

### 3.2 Google Script
The Google Script will serve as the server side code to organize the data, and to send it over to the client side.

### 3.3 HTML Files
The HTML file will consist of two pages, one for the user to sign up to view the google form data. This will consist of a form to allow user to enter an email so that they can receieve an url to view the form data.

The second will be a table to show all the data specifc to the user.

## 4. Wireframe
Mockups of the Web App solution are presented below.

## 5. Pseudocode 
- For every form submission, find who submitted the data, and then update the data tab. Add the new row number to the respective user.
- When doGET() runs, it will serve the HTML data
- When the HTML file is served, wait until the HTML is served and then run Javascript file to extract data.
- Once data returns create new DOM nodes and fill the table for user to view data.
